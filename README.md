# Genetic Programming Tree (Java)

A Java implementation of a Genetic Programming expression tree system.
The project represents mathematical expressions as trees, supports traversal
via a collector pattern, and performs randomized subtree crossover for
evolutionary computation.

## Features
- Expression trees using object-oriented design
- Preorder traversal with a Collector interface
- Safe evaluation with division-by-zero handling
- Deep-copy support for genetic operations
- Randomized subtree crossover between trees

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Tree Data Structures
- Genetic Programming Concepts

## Example
The included TestGPTree class demonstrates:
- Random tree generation
- Expression evaluation
- Genetic crossover between trees
